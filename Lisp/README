Part 1:

Part one was more straight forward, it passes all tests.
We implemented one additional function that was not in the slide, 
We used the suggested function on piazza: remove-if and remove-if-not.

Part 2:

Our part two passes all tests and is fully functional.
We reffered to the discussion slides and followed the algorithm.
This part was also straight forward.

Part 3:

This part is more tricky.
We have not finished this part. We have the bare skeleton from the discussion slides. 
We are attempting to implement the the algorithm on the slides. 
So far, In addition to the skeleton, we added checks for the nil cases 
and also reseted the variables by setting them to nil.
We pass the test files for some of the files, but we will need to further debug 
and add to the skeleton code.
